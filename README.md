# MLflow-project
Using MLflow to log machine learning model metrics when predicting temperature 


Scope: 
In this project I am predicting the mean temperature in London. This involves importing, preprocessing, and exploring historical weather data and automate the training and evaluation of multiple machine learning models. This will be setup in an automated workflow using functions, utilizing methods from sklearn and MLflow.


Structure: 

1. Loading the data

2. Data cleaning

3. Exploratory data analysis

4. Feature selection

5. Preprocess data

6. Machine learning training and evaluation

7. Searching logged results
